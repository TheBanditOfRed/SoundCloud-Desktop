# SoundCloud Desktop

A simple desktop wrapper for SoundCloud with some quality-of-life improvements.

## What it does

This is just the SoundCloud website in a desktop window, but with a few nice touches:

- **Desktop app feel**: SoundCloud in its own window instead of a browser tab
- **No distractions**: Just SoundCloud, nothing else

More features are in development!

## Installation

### Run from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheBanditOfRed/Soundcloud-Desktop.git
cd soundcloud-desktop
npm install
npm start
```

## Pre-built binaries
In the current version (v1.0.0), there are no pre-built binaries available. You'll need to run from source for now.

## That's it

It's literally just SoundCloud in Electron with better popup handling and some UI polish. Nothing fancy.
